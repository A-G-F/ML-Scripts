# Serve folder with Jekyll
**Jekyll Serve Folder** is a System service in Finder and other native applications with integrated file browser.

### Serve a folder with Jekyll with a single ctrl-click: 
Jekyll will be started in a free Terminal session (script does recognize if active window is busy and chooses a free one or creates a new one if necessary).

Jekyll will serve the folder with address http//0.0.0.0:4000 and watch for changes. A browser window will open that location after a 10 seconds delay.

#### Requirements:
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

<hr>

**To install the service, just double click it.**
