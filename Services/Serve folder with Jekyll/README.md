#Serve folder with Jekyll
**Jekyll Serve Folder** is a System service in Finder and other native (not Java!) applications with integrated file browser.

**Serve a folder with Jekyll with a single ctrl-click:**  
Jekyll will be started in a free Terminal session (it does recognize if active window is busy and choose a free one or create a new one if necessary).

Jekyll will serve the folder with address http//0.0.0.0:4000 and watch for changes. A browser window will open that location with a 10 seconds delay.

To install the service, just double click it.
